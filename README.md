# Install

If you have decently updated npm and node installs, you should just have to do a

````
 > npm install. 
````

# Local Server

I'm using the webpack dev server. To start, 

````
> webpack
> webpack serve
````

Might have to do an npx, if you don't have webpack cli.

````
> npx webpack
> npx webpack serve
````

The webpack dev server should watch for further changes to the source and hot reload stuff.
